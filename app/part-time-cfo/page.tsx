          <h2>What is a Part-Time CFO?</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>part-time CFO</strong> (also known as a fractional CFO or outsourced CFO) is an experienced Chief Financial Officer who provides strategic financial leadership to companies on a flexible, part-time basis. Rather than committing to a single full-time role, part-time CFOs typically work with multiple clients, dedicating 1-3 days per week to each engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demand for <strong>part-time CFO jobs</strong> in the UK has grown significantly over the past five years, driven by the rise of startups, scale-ups, and SMEs that need senior financial expertise but cannot justify or afford a full-time hire. Companies typically engage a part-time CFO when they reach Series A funding, need to prepare financial models for investors, or require board-level financial reporting.
          </p>

          <h2>Part-Time CFO vs Full-Time CFO</h2>
          <p>
            The key difference between a part-time CFO and a traditional full-time CFO lies in the engagement model. A full-time CFO works exclusively for one company, typically earning £150,000-£300,000 annually plus benefits. A <strong>part-time Chief Financial Officer</strong>, by contrast, works with 2-4 clients simultaneously, charging day rates of £800-£1,500.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many experienced CFOs, the part-time model offers significant advantages: higher effective hourly earnings, greater variety in work, portfolio diversification, and improved work-life balance. For companies, hiring a part-time CFO provides access to senior talent at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire.
          </p>

          <h2>Who Hires Part-Time CFOs?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Part-time CFO jobs</strong> are most common in the following company types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Venture-backed startups</strong> - Companies at Series A or B stage that need fundraising support, financial modelling, and investor relations expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Private equity portfolio companies</strong> - PE firms often require part-time CFOs to strengthen finance functions across their investments</li>
            <li><strong>Scale-ups</strong> - Fast-growing companies (£5-50m revenue) that have outgrown their bookkeeper but aren't ready for a full-time CFO</li>
            <li><strong>SMEs preparing for exit</strong> - Business owners planning a sale who need to professionalise their finances</li>
            <li><strong>Turnaround situations</strong> - Companies in financial distress that need experienced leadership</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Part-Time CFO Salary and Day Rates</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Part-time CFO</strong> compensation in the UK typically ranges from £800 to £1,500 per day, depending on experience, industry specialisation, and location. London-based roles command premium rates, with City and Canary Wharf engagements often paying £1,200-£1,500 per day.
          </p>
          <p>
            A part-time CFO working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients can realistically earn £150,000-£250,000 annually. The most experienced fractional CFOs with strong networks and repeat clients can earn significantly more.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>Part-time CFO responsibilities typically include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial strategy development and execution</li>
            <li>Cash flow forecasting and management</li>
            <li>Fundraising support and investor relations</li>
            <li>Board reporting and financial governance</li>
            <li>Budget creation and monitoring</li>
            <li>Financial systems and process improvement</li>
            <li>Team leadership and finance function development</li>
            <li>M&A support and due diligence</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to Become a Part-Time CFO</h2>
          <p>
            Transitioning to a <strong>part-time CFO career</strong> typically requires 15+ years of finance experience, including at least 5 years in senior leadership roles. Most successful part-time CFOs hold professional qualifications (ACA, ACCA, CIMA) and have experience across multiple industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building a portfolio of clients takes time. Many part-time CFOs start by taking on one or two fractional engagements alongside consulting work, gradually building their client base through referrals and networking. Platforms like <Link href="/fractional-jobs">Fractional Quest</Link> can help connect experienced CFOs with companies seeking part-time finance leadership.
          </p>

          <h2>Part-Time CFO Jobs in London</h2>
          <p>
            London remains the UK's largest market for <strong>part-time CFO jobs</strong>, accounting for approximately 60% of all fractional finance roles. The City, Shoreditch, and Canary Wharf are particularly active markets, with strong demand from fintech, SaaS, and PE-backed companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, and Bristol all have growing fractional CFO markets, though day rates are typically 15-25% lower than London equivalents.
